# CrimeWeb
A web app that displays a lot of data from Chicago crimes using SQL, C#, .NET

There is a good chance the SQL database will not have a connection because this was done using a database provided by a professor
However, all of the data and query examples are there for people trying to learn how to run sql queries using C# then displaying
the data on a webpage
